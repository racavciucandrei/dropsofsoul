      description: 'This cocktail is as exciting and layered as the city itself. It starts with freshly muddled ginger for a spicy kick, balanced by sweet mango puree. The lemongrass and verbena cordial adds a fresh, aromatic dimension, while lime juice provides essential acidity. Coconut-infused aged rum creates a tropical base that carries all the flavors. The combination of dried mango bitters and Szechuan and cacao bitters adds depth and complexity. The finishing touch: a silky lemongrass espuma crowned with freshly grated nutmeg, offering a creamy, aromatic contrast to the zesty and spicy profile below. A true sensory adventure that leaves you wanting moreâ€”just like an unforgettable night in Bangkok.',
